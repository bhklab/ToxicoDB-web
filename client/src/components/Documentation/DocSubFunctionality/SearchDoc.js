            â€™s search bar takes three types of queries. The simplest is to query for a single gene; rat or human, (e.g., CYP1A1) or compound (e.g., Acetaminophen ).

        <p>One can use the search to query for the association of a specific compound-gene pair (e.g., Carbon tetrachloride, CYP1A1), in a dataset. This query will direct you to a page plotting gene expression versus time plot.</p>
